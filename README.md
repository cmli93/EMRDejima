1. install those plugs first:


   - Ganache `https://truffleframework.com/ganache`

3. deploy smart contract (i.e., contracts/queryMeta.sol) to 
   blockchain by

  `truffle migrate`

4. interact with smart contract by

Then your chrome explorer will open the webpage automatically. (If not, please open your metamask)

Next, start interact with it.
